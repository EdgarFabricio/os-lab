This time I create a program named finder.
finder goes over all the linux_source files and find all .c and .h files that there exists.
To do this first we have to download the linux source files, it could be done by typing the **sudo apt-get install linux-source** command.
finder will automatically go to the /usr/src directory, which is the default installation directory for the linux source.
